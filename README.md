# Machine-Learning-Implementation
---
This repo is intended to explore and implement Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch and by using libraries such as Sci-Kit Learn. 
Note that the **aim is to understand the math behind the algorithms and implement them in raw mode, and not to perform better than any library 
implementation out there.**

There are three main folders - 
1. Algorithms from Scratch
2. Algorithms using Scikit Learn
3. Pre-requisites/Tutorials

## Algorithms from Scratch

The 1st folder contains the algorithms implemented totally from scratch. However, libraries such as Pandas, NumPy. Matplotlib and Seaborn have been used for the sake of 
Data Exploration and Visualization. The algorithms have a section called Calculation-Know-How to showcase the working of algorithm on a single training example
and then implementing it on all the examples just using pure Python and NumPy. All the algorithms have a Model Performance section to evaluate the performance of 
the model after prediction on test examples.

## Algorithms using Scikit Learn <img src = "https://img.shields.io/badge/ScikitLearn-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikitlearn&logoColor=white">

The 2nd folder contains the algorithms built using Sci-Kit Learn. This section implements the algorithms taking use of all libraries. This section too focuses on 
model evaluation by using traaditional metrics intended for each of the algorithm.

## Pre-requisites/Tutorials 
The 3rd folder contains jupyter notebooks with tutorials to NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. There's also a seperate repo for all the tutorials with their 
respective Jupyter notebooks out there.

Note that, the repo is not complete. I intend to keep working on it with learning on the go throughout my journey.

Thanks
